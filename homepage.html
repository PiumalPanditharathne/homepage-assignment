        <p>
            Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations
            or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike <a href="homepage.html">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but
            intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe
            distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
        </p>

        <p>
            Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</strong>
            as you navigate routes close to the ground, Bouldering is both
            <strong>accessible to beginners</strong> and <strong>challenging for experts</strong>.
